# Data-Cleaning-In-Excel
In the first file, i have a bunch of uncleaned data with about 8 columns and 45 rows.
I was able to organize and clean this file in the second file, removing duplicates and formatting the date stle to short date for uniformity.
I also changed the currency from $ to numbers incase i might have to export to Microsoft SQL server Management Studio for analysis. 
It is a relatively small dataset but i cleaned it up!
